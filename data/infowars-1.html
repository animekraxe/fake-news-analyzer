Yes, Really…</h1>Of course, it’s no secret why she wants to sweep it all under the prayer mat<div><span><a href="http://louderwithcrowder.com/clinton-state-dept-terrorists-benghazi/"><strong>Louder With Crowder</strong></a> - </span><span>November 8, 2016</span>
<span><a href="https://www.infowars.com/clinton-state-dept-hired-terrorists-for-security-in-benghazi-yes-really/#disqus_thread">Comments</a></span></div><div><p><strong>Most humans with basic motor function skills agree that when it comes to Benghazi, Hillary Clinton and her State Department dropped the ball. In a well. Full of lava. Well, now it looks like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/11/07/benghazi-guards-turned-on-us-diplomats-in-2012-attack-sources-say.html">they screwed up even worse than we thought</a>. Hard to imagine, I know. Hold on to your butts…</strong></p><blockquote><p>An obscure private firm hired by the State Department over internal objections to protect U.S. diplomats in Benghazi just months before the American ambassador and three others were killed was staffed with hastily recruited locals with terror ties who helped carry out the attack, multiple sources told Fox News.</p><p>Clare Lopez, a member of Citizens’ Commission on Benghazi, said the Clinton State Department bears blame for the security situation.</p><p>“Think about it: Hillary Clinton’s State Department actually hired the very people who, along with their jihadist allies in Benghazi, attacked us and killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and Sean Smith as well as CIA contractors Glen Doherty and Ty Woods,” Lopez said.</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, it’s bad. In case you haven’t noticed, Hillary has been trying&nbsp;<a href="http://louderwithcrowder.com/benghazi-mom-still-waiting-for-phone-call-from-hillary/">to get us all to move on from Benghazi for a while</a>. Probably like her stylist keeps trying to get her to move on from the “lesbian troglodyte” hairstyle. Bad haircuts are a fad. Among Democrats in particular. But the senseless loss of American lives? Not so easily brushed off. Still, Hillary gives not a single rodent’s behind. Because what difference does it make, right?</p><p>Of course, it’s no secret why she wants to sweep it all under the prayer mat. She made a mistake of Michael Moore proportions… And we’re&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;uncovering the extent to which she messed up years later.
</p><p>Footage of Clinton’s State Dept handling Benghazi</p><p>We already knew that Hillary Clinton was a lying gutterbeast (see&nbsp;<a href="http://louderwithcrowder.com/clinton-on-benghazi-we-didnt-lose-anyone/">Clinton on Benghazi: ‘We Didn’t Lose a Single Person.’</a>). We’ve known for a while that she’s capable of being corrupt and inept. Between Benghazi, her emails, and this election, the broad has enough scandals to last a lifetime. The worst part? People are still voting for her. Because who needs national security when you can have a menopausal woman as President?</p><p>Hence why voters need to be made aware of things like this. To Hillary, these are simply speed bumps on the road to smashing through glass ceilings. Chalk it up to collateral damage.</p><p>The lesson here? Non-vetted Muslims are always a bad idea.&nbsp;<a href="http://louderwithcrowder.com/isis-shave-beard-wear-christian-cross-to-blend-in/">Ask Europe</a>. But more importantly, putting Hillary in a leadership position is an even worse idea. Just another reason to add to the list…</p></div></div></div>
