But the warehouse superstore is now making headlines for a very different reason, and it could serve to tarnish their brand: The Blue Angels accidentally flew into the Costco in Augusta, GA and are currently stuck flying around inside the discount retailer.</p><p>Worst of all, it doesn’t seem like Costco has any idea how to get the airplane stunt squadron to leave.</p><p>The Blue Angels were performing at a routine air show in Augusta, GA earlier today when they veered too close to the Costco and zipped through the automatic doors as they slid open for a customer. Before Costco employees could react, the diamond formation of five F/A-18 Hornets had entered the store and began performing death-defying aerial feats right over the shelves of bulk cereals and jumbo-size ketchups.</p><p>Customers are trying to ignore the roaring jets overhead, but it’s hard to concentrate on your shopping list when sonic booms keep knocking over pallets of Kirkland-brand dog food. It’s usually a welcome treat to see the Blue Angels conduct synchronized barrel rolls, but inside Costco, the elite pilots are proving to be a serious nuisance.</p><p>So far all attempts to evict the Blue Angels have proved unsuccessful. At first, Costco staff just propped the front door open with a bucket, assuming the Blue Angels would find their way back out eventually. After an hour, when choreographed smoke trails continued to plague the store, the manager grabbed a lacrosse stick from a sporting goods display and tried to shoo the planes toward the exit. Unfortunately, that only caused the Blue Angels to accelerate to 700 mph and perform several loop-the-loops in the freezer aisle, where the pilots hit a truly exhilarating 8 G’s.</p><p>Your heart just has to break for this poor manager.</p><p>With the store set to close in only a few hours, Costco better think up a solution fast, or Blue Angels will be locked in overnight. If that happens, then tomorrow’s customers will be aggravated by more of the same world-class aeronautic showmanship. What an absolute hassle.</p></div></div></div></div>
