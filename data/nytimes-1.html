  <div><div>2012</div></div></div></div></div><div><p>The proportion of voters living in counties that were won in a landslide for the Democratic or Republican presidential candidate has steadily increased over the last seven elections and now makes up a whopping 60 percent of the electorate.</p></div><div><p>Nearly all of this 10-point increase from 2012 came from Republicans in rural and small-town America, who swept Donald J. Drumpf into office.</p></div><div><p>For the first time since 2004, the last time a Republican won the White House, the voters in the less populous but more numerous deep red counties accounted for a greater share of the total vote than those in the far fewer but more populous bluest ones.</p></div><div><p>In 1992, 38 percent of voters lived in one of these landslide counties, defined here as being won by 20 percentage points or more. This shift reflects the growing tendency of like-minded people to live near one another, according to Bill Bishop, a co-author of “The Big Sort,” a 2008 book that identified this phenomenon.</p></div><div><p>Mr. Bishop said Americans have been self-segregating by lifestyle, though not necessarily politics, for several decades, but lifestyle has grown to reflect politics. “We’re sorting by the way we live, think and — it turns out — every four years or every two years, how we vote.”</p></div><div><h2>Who Lives in These Counties</h2></div><div><p>Republican landslide counties are generally whiter than Democratic ones.</p></div><div><div><div><div>Each colored stripe represents one landslide county in the nation. This chart shows the percentage of each county that is white.</div></div></div></div><div><p>But whites in Democratic strongholds tend to be wealthier ...</p></div><div><div><div><div>Percentage of white households in each landslide county making more than $100,000 a year.</div></div></div></div><div><p>… and more educated.</p></div><div><div><div><div>Percentage of whites with at least a bachelor’s degree.</div></div></div></div><div><p>People in Republican strongholds are more likely to be married ...</p></div><div><div><div><div>Percentage of the population of each landslide county that is married.</div></div></div></div><div><p>... and religious.</p></div><div><div><div><div>Percentage that adheres to a religion.</div></div></div></div><div><p>People in the bluest counties are more likely to work in “new economy” sectors like technology and health care services.</p></div><div><div><div><div>Percentage of civilian workers in each landslide county employed in the new economy.</div></div></div></div><div><p>A larger share of those in Republican landslide counties rely on “old economy” industries like manufacturing, agriculture and trade.</p></div><div><div><div><div>Percentage of civilian workers in each landslide county employed in the old economy.</div></div></div></div><div><h2>How the Counties Compare</h2></div><div><p>There are now nine times as many Republican landslide counties as Democratic ones.</p></div><div><div><div><p><b>242</b></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
